        &nbsp;&nbsp; I have been reading about music theory for a few weeks, it is still alien to me. I setup a Digital Audio Workstation, and searched for tutorials on how to use one. I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/music-education">this course</a> on Coursera. It introduces the idea of a DAW in introduction, but the later content seems to be different than teaching how to use a DAW. It should teach me some music culture anyway so I will continue. It requires to setup a personal blog, which happens to be the thing I started doing yesterday.
