        &nbsp;&nbsp;This is an inspiring ted talk on the philosophy of old Coursera: <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/daphne_koller_what_we_re_learning_from_online_education?utm_source=tedcomshare&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tedspread">What we are learning from online education?</a>. I took a lot of precious valuable courses from old Coursera. Ranging from, Food and Nutrition, Brief History of Humankind, Constitution, Resilient, Beginners Guide to Irrational Behaviour, Property Law, to Computer Networking, Startup Engineering, Cryptography, Databases, Software Security, Computer Hardware, Matrices and Linear Algebra with Python, Compiler, Functional Programming with Scala, and some more I can't remember. And it's not just about video lectures, but the community, real time schedules, assignments and quizzes were all part of it. It sucks to shut it down and remove all of these amazing courses. I dropped out of college and resent this occasionally. World needs this service, especially in these pandemic times more than ever. I hope we will get it back some day.
