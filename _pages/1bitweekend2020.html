&nbsp;&nbsp; I submitted my platformer to js13k. Looking for new ideas, I stumbled upon a video about a game called Project Arrhythmia. I bought it on Steam because it had a level editor. It gave me ideas about level design and implementation of such a game. Now, I am making a similar game. I will submit it to 1-Bit Weekend Jam. It lasts for two days and there is a restriction of using only two colors. Also there is a theme I didn't use. I coded the mechanics in 1 day previous the jam has started, made some random music and sound effects. I am using Pico-8. This is a game about music and rhythm, and this is the first game I made music for. Got some feedback from Jam's discord. Next I will add a level with a boss and submit.
